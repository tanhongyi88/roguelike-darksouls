## 4. Process Model
The process model that is used is modified scrum. It will be different from the normal scrum since this project requires a shorter time to be completed. Therefore, the time period of each sprint will be shorter compared to normal scrum.Besides, normal scrum has daily standup meetings. However, the team only has meetings once or twice a week. In addition, the team will only write the retrospective report once at the end of the third sprint compared to normal scrum which will be writing the retrospective report after every sprint. Lastly, during inception there should be an initial product backlog in normal scrum, but the team didn't have it in our inception.

## 5. Time and Task Tracking
#### Task Allocation
The tasks will be allocated based on the role assigned during the project inception. Here is a plan to allocate the tasks evenly:
1. Identify all the tasks in each sprint.
2. Allocate tasks evenly among the team members, making use of team strengths or areas where development is desired by team members.
3. Ensure agreement from team members to take on specified tasks.
4. The tasks allocated will be recorded as Trello cards with labels of team members assigned in Trello boards (kanban boards).
5. Scrum Master will be managing the project by helping the team to come to an agreement rather than making decisions to avoid arguments within the team.

#### Progress Tracking
Progress is tracked using multiple kanban boards in Trello, which can be accessed by both the development team and the product owner. Firstly, the product backlog is used to store each of the user stories under sections that are categorized into themes and epics. These stories will have a checkmark that shows whether they’re done and completed stories will be moved down the section as they’re no longer prioritized in further sprints. 

Secondly, the sprint backlog will be used to store each of the stories that are to be implemented during each sprint, and are categorized into to be done, doing, and done. Stories are added to the sprint backlog during sprint planning, which is held before each sprint is started. In addition, the sprint backlog is reviewed after each sprint, and will be updated with new stories to be completed in the upcoming sprint.

#### Time Tracking
Time tracking will be done in another document titled “Work Breakdown Agreement”. The document contains the contributions by each team member and time taken to complete specific tasks. This document will also be checked regularly by our Product Owner, Miss Kamala.

Policies and procedures:
1. Team members can track his or her time by themselves while working on the project.
2. Team members can update the contributions and the time taken on the “Work Breakdown Agreement”.

#### Tools and Systems
Multiple tools and systems are used during the development of the program, and both the development team and the product owner will have access to these tools. They are:
1. Communication
    - Zoom 
    - Whatsapp
2. Development
    - Visual Studio Code
    - [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/fit210118/8262efb05c0ee6e9abc1face7a121328 )
    - Git
    - [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10DRXgl30SOpqP7K2_ZIgGPjtiqhu_8hY?usp=sharing)
3. Debugging
    - Google Chrome

## 6. Definition of Done
Functionalities that are implemented during each sprint have to go through a set of procedures to make sure that they are ready to be shipped. The procedures to make sure they are done are as below:
1. Code is written and documented based on community accepted guidelines
2. During coding, unit testing is run and passed
3. Acceptance criteria is met
4. Code review is conducted together as a team, to identify any bugs and misunderstandings within the code
5. Program is run through system tests for functional requirements and passes all of them
6. Non-functional requirements are met
7. Product is reviewed by the product owner, and satisfies them
